                Ever met a guy named “Ashley” before? Well, now you have. My name is Ashley John F. Lopez, often called Ash or Ley. I’ll start my biography from the very beginning, my younger days.
                I would always wake up early in the morning to play with my friends. We’d run around the alley playing traditional Filipino games like Patintero, Tumbang Preso, or Luksong Baka. 
                Even though the sun was scorching and we were drenched in sweat, we were genuinely happy. However, afternoons were never mine to enjoy. I could clearly remember my Lolo’s strict rule—we had to take naps in the afternoon so we could grow taller. There were many of us cousins, all boys, so we all squeezed together on the foam bed in my Lolo’s house. 
                But my love for playing led me to escape often, and sometimes, my pretending to be asleep would become real due to exhaustion. I vividly remember sneaking down the wooden stairs so Lolo wouldn’t hear me. 
                Sometimes, I’d get caught and immediately run away laughing. That’s how I earned the nickname “Ashley Demonyo.”
                Every time we came back from playing, there was always a snack waiting for us—like Turon, Monay, and Pancit Canton with iced tea. If we weren’t out in the streets of Tondo, we were at the computer shop, laughing and playing DOTA, Crossfire, or League of Legends. 
                People often described me as mischievous and playful. As a child, I was always curious and wanted to explore new things. But despite my joyful demeanor, I sometimes felt like an outsider, struggling to fit in and express myself. 
                So, as I grew older, I found comfort in playing online games at home, where I could connect with people without the fear of judgment.

                When I turned sixteen, I became fully addicted to the computer. I spent most of my time playing with friends from different parts of the Philippines and even abroad. I believe this is one of the reasons why I could only make friends online, but struggled in real life. 
                I got used to spending time in front of my computer, eating while gaming. My parents often scolded me because my life seemed to revolve around gaming. 
                During my junior to senior high school years, I studied at Manila Cathedral School. I met many people there who changed my perspective on life. 
                It was during my teenage years that I really became aware of reality and started forming relationships. I was eighteen when I had my first girlfriend. 
                That period taught me a lot, even though the relationship didn’t end well. I didn’t just break up with her; I also lost friends due to a false accusation. 
                It was a huge wake-up call for me, realizing how quickly things could change due to misunderstandings and toxic people. On the other hand, I also struggled a lot with my mental health. 
                One stereotype people have about men is that they should be masculine. I guess I adapted to that, choosing to keep my problems to myself, crying quietly at night to fall asleep. 
                Fortunately, I met my current girlfriend. We’ve been together for almost a year, and despite being young, we share wonderful dreams for our future as individuals and as a couple. 
                I now realize that being in a healthy relationship is possible because we share the same faith. I’ve learned a lot from her, such as opening up and letting go of my pride—things I struggled with before. 
                Surrounding yourself with the right people really shapes who you are as a person, and that’s why I choose the people I hang out with.

                Currently, as a second-year teenager studying IT, I still face confusion and mental instability. I chose to study at the University of the East (UE) despite my second thoughts about what course I should pursue. 
                It was one of the biggest stressors during my Senior High School years—I didn’t know what I wanted to do. It put a lot of pressure on me because I knew I eventually had to make a choice. 
                I struggled between choosing Education, Tourism Management, and IT. But since I thought IT was in-demand and closer to my love for computer gaming, I reluctantly chose IT. 
                The process wasn’t easy, and neither is the course. I often find myself struggling to understand lessons and not performing well in school. But to this day, I’m striving to be better because my dream is to graduate, be successful, and make my parents proud. 
                They’ve worked so hard to provide for my needs and wants, and I look forward to the day when I can repay their hard work. I also plan to take responsibility for my younger brother so that my mom can finally relax once I graduate. 
                College is never easy, especially when you lack passion for studying. It’s something I’m still figuring out, hoping to enjoy making codes. 
                Additionally, I’ve met my college friends—people I work with during discussions and group projects. They are reliable and each has their own personality. Some are great at studies, some are the fun ones, and some I just hang out with in school. 
                Despite all the challenges, I hope to learn a lot in my IT course and graduate alongside my friends.
